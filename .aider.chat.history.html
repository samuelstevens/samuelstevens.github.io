<p>The script will: 1. Fetch the webpage and extract its title 2. Read
the existing links.json 3. Add the new link with current timestamp 4.
Write the updated JSON back to the file</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong fetching the title, it will use the URL as the
title and continue.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ll modify the script to handle arXiv links specially. We&#x2019;ll need
to: 1. Add URL parsing and arXiv handling 2. Modify the title extraction
for arXiv papers 3. Ensure we store PDF links when requested</p>

<p>The script will now: 1. Detect arXiv URLs and normalize them for
title fetching 2. Strip [XXXX.XXXXX] prefixes from arXiv titles 3. Store
PDF or abs links based on the input URL format 4. Handle both PDF and

<p>Let&#x2019;s add URL normalization that handles: 1. Trailing slashes 2.
Default ports (80/443) 3. Protocol (http vs https) 4. Case sensitivity
in hostnames 5. URL encoding/decoding where appropriate 6. Query
parameter ordering</p>

a link is an arxiv link, it should be automatically treated as a paper.
So you can ignore the <code>paper</code> argument and instead just set
