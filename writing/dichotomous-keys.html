href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.151054">Keys
and the Crisis in Taxonomy: Extinction or Reinvention?</a> presents some
discussion on dichotomous key design in the context of taxonomists
becoming rarer. The authors include a list of ten rules to incorporate
when designing keys. Nine of the rules are UI/UX in my opinion (use
images, includ contrasting options, beta-test your key, etc.). One rule
is use a balanced tree whenever possible (which is a nice computer
science concept). They also suggest making it easy to backtrack, and
this has come up in converations with field taxonomists as well: if you
end up at a classification that is clearly wrong, it&#x2019;s easy to go back
to the decision that you were least certain about and then take the
other path. It might be interesting to incorporate some of that thinking
into the tree design as well.</p>
