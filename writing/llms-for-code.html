<h1 id="llms-for-code">LLMs for Code</h1>
<p>Programming is a super popular application for LLMs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of using generative AI for autocomplete in a text editor is
a really significant innovation, and is still my favorite example of a
non-chat UI for interacting with models.</p>
<p><a

Willison, 2024</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#x2019;s popular because individual pieces of code are designed
to be separable (modular), they often have extremely clear goals
(docstrings describe what a function does and why you might use it), and
there are very clear patterns in the language without exceptions
(syntax, grammars, etc do not have exceptions like human languages).
Furthermore, it can be extremely complex, making it comparatively hard
for humans, so even a non-AGI LLM can be incredibly useful for
autocomplete.</p>
<p>However, I think that a lot of AI research does not take advantage of
the non-AI tools in place to make programming easier for humans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One exception to this statement is <a
href="https://aider.chat/">Aider</a>. It uses a custom <a
href="https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html">repo map</a>, <a
href="https://aider.chat/docs/usage/conventions.html">reads
<code>CONVENTION.md</code> files</a>, <a
href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">has an editing-specific
benchmark</a>. In general, Aider is an excellent set of engineering
practices to make code editing with LLMs easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The academic community is primarily focused on building more
realistic benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06770">SWE-Bench</a> and its
variants (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03859">SWE-Bench
Multimodal</a>, <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06992">SWE-Bench+</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01769">Commit0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08604">DevEval</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14161">TheAgentCompany</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is plenty of work developing individual systems to attack these
benchmarks (primarily SWE-Bench or SWE-Bench Lite). <a
href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01489">The Agentless paper</a> compares
many approaches in Table 1.</p>
<p>However, I feel that these papers present individual systems, which
are necessarily going to be improved upon by more complex systems, more
expensive systems, or better engineered systems. I would prefer to see
papers that propose individual techniques, ideally adding a technique
like <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10763">static
analysis-constrained decoding</a> to many different existing systems,
then recommending when it&#x2019;s worth it to add the complexity of such a
method to a system.</p>
<p>This relates to some preliminary thinking of mine on <a
