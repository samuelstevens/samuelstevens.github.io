<h1 id="abstractions-and-types">Abstractions and Types</h1>
<p>Abstraction in programming is a powerful tool that lets us make
larger systems with fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>Functions are the easiest example of an abstraction. Not all
abstractions are good (see <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">the
law of leaky abstractions</a>) but having rock-solid abstractions is
very useful (see <a
href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practical-magic">practical
magic</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to functions, types are an abstraction. Your variables
don&#x2019;t always have to be <code>int</code>, even if that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re
represented as. For example, <code>time_t</code> is often just an
<code>int</code>, but functions like <code>time()</code> return
<code>time_t</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>Historically (as far as I understand), types were important so the
computer knew how much space to allocate for a variable. C and its
derivatives (I&#x2019;m not very familiar with languages before C) are
statically typed (not strongly typed).</p>
<p>Then dynamically typed languages that were aimed at lower performance
and a higher rate of development came about (like Python and Ruby).
Dynamically typed languages let you assign variables to different types
because the variables are all reference types (so the computer only
needs space for a memory address). You didn&#x2019;t need to worry about types,
you could just <em>code</em> as fast as you wanted and make things work
consistently later on.</p>
<p>If you build a moderately large codebase in one of these languages,
you might notice that things start to get hard pretty quickly. The lack
of types can lead to many runtime errors. Now we have TypeScript and
Python type annotations, so we can do some static type checking before
running our programs to eliminate runtime errors just like you would
with Java.</p>
<p>But even if you don&#x2019;t use static type checking (which I mostly use
when I make changes to a function signature), types are <em>very
useful</em>.</p>
<p>Types are more for developers than the computer (following the trend
of developer time being more valuable than computer time), and I want to
explain one significant instance where this is true.</p>
<p>Like I said before, functions are a level of abstraction. They
package up a series of operations. Every programmer knows this.
Functional programming is built around this abstraction.</p>
<p>You want to be able to use a function without knowing how it works
inside. That&#x2019;s the whole idea of an abstraction in programming: you hide
the hard, messy concept behind something easier, like a function. In C,
this sort of thing is easy. You have both <code>typedef</code>, which
gives you names for types, even if they&#x2019;re just basic types like
<code>int</code> or <code>char</code>. You also have function
signatures. In theory, a function name, return type, parameter names and
parameter types are enough to use a function. You don&#x2019;t need to
understand the internal implementation to use the function.</p>
<p>In dynamically typed languages, like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, you
don&#x2019;t get the function return type or parameter types. This makes it
difficult to use functions, both library and your own functions without
looking them up. If you can&#x2019;t use functions you wrote without
remembering the implementation, how much time are functions saving
you?</p>
<p>Types are an abstraction that helps you use your own code more
effectively. Take advantage of this.</p>
