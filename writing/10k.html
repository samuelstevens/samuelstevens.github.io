<h1 id="ten-thousand">Ten Thousand</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/tenthousand">I wrote a
small tool to track progress of whatever you want to 10K of
<em>something</em> in a year.</a> I plan on using it to try and do 10K
pullups and 10K minutes of meditation in 2025.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the realization that 30 pullups a day for 334 days
is 10,020 pullups. This means that if you do 6 sets of 5 pullups
throughout the day, and only miss 31 days (an entire month!) you can do
10K pullups, which is a phenomenal achievement.</p>
<p>I wanted a small tool to track this for me to see if I was behind or
not. <a href="/writing/personal-software">I love building one-off tools
for this sort of thing</a>. Previously I would have used Go for this
tool, but with <a
href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">inline
uv dependencies</a> it&#x2019;s really easy to build Python scripts that are
self-contained without a virtual environment. I also loved reading <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/">Simon
Willison&#x2019;s description of this kind of workflow</a>.</p>
<p>I used <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script --quiet</code> as a
shebang so that it runs with uv without any uv-specific details.</p>
<p>I also built this entire app with Claude via <a
href="https://aider.chat">aider</a>. It wrote like 95% of the code, with
me making mild stylistic changes as we progressed. Especially for CLI
utilities, aider is really nice because it will run the script, then
read the output, then update the code to deal with any exceptions. It&#x2019;s
a phenomenal workflow and I can&#x2019;t get over</p>
