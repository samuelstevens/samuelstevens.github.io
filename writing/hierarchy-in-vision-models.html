<h1 id="hierarchy-in-vision-models">Hierarchy in Vision Models</h1>
<p>This page is a mini literature review, mostly for my own purposes,
used for the BioCLIP work. I update this page as I have time and energy
to read and write about new papers. If you feel that your work should be
mentioned here, please email me.</p>
<p>Our ICLR reviews for BioCLIP included lots of missing work, which
forms the basis for my literature review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, ImageNet always refers to the 1K class
variant from the ILSVRC 2012 challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, I find the literature on hierarchy in vision to have two
main conclusions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Computer vision models naturally learn hierarchical structures</li>
<li>Hierarchical objectives never outperform regular objectives.</li>
</ol>
<p>But if you disagree, let me know!</p>

categories.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06501">Bilal et al.&#xA0;2017</a>
(<em>Do Convolutional Neural Networks Learn Class Hierarchy?</em>,
<strong>Block</strong>) develop a novel visual interface for analyzing
CNN outputs on ImageNet. Honestly, they do a ton of important
interpretability work and this paper is very full of insights. However,
I am only interested in section 4.1.3, where they propose a new
architecture to take advantage of the hierarchy present in ImageNet.
Features from earlier layers branch into small fully-connected layers
that predict coarser features. I assume the final loss is a sum of
cross-entropy losses among all the levels in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>The authors find that this improved AlexNet leads to better top 1
error (42.6% to 34.3%). However, they note that this helps the issue of
vanishing gradients because gradients for earlier layers are computed
from the coarse-grained loss term. If the majority of the improvement
comes from fixing vanishing gradients, then ResNets would not benefit
from this multitask objective because they deal with vanishing gradients
through the residual connections.</p>

et al.&#xA0;2019</a> (<em>A Weakly Supervised Fine Label Classifier Enhanced

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09393">Bertinetto et al.&#xA0;2020</a>
(<em>Making Better Mistakes: Leveraging Class Hierarchies with Deep
Networks</em>) propose measure mistake <em>severity</em>, wherein
pedicting &#x201C;dog&#x201D; instead for the true label &#x201C;cat&#x201D; is a better mistake
than predicting &#x201C;jet plane&#x201D;. They propose measuring mistake severity
through tree distance in the hierarchical structure of ImageNet
categories. While top-1 error decreased on ImageNet from 2012 to 2017
(and later), mistake severity did not. They propose two different
training objectives, hierarchical cross entropy (HXE) and a soft
(probability distribution) label on two hierarchical datasets,
tieredImageNet and iNat19. They find that their hierarchy-aware training
objectives lead to better mistake severity (lower tree distance when a
prediction is wrong) but worse top-1 accuracy.</p>
<p>In general, I personally think this trade-off of top-1 accuracy vs
better mistakes to be inescapable. Given that the computer vision
community has optimized for top-1 accuracy (and specifically top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1K), unless we can:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find one or more examples of where better mistakes, with lower top-1
accuracy, lead to better real-world outcomes.</li>
<li>Set up a strong benchmark that is easy to evaluate and consistently
correlates with real-world outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then we will never care about &#x201C;making better mistakes&#x201D; over ImageNet
top-1 accuracy. It&#x2019;s simply too useful to throw away.</p>

href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13768">Elhamod
et al.&#xA0;2021</a> (<em>Hierarchy-guided neural network for species
classification</em>, <strong>HGNN</strong>) train two ResNets, one to
classify the genus, and one to classify the species. The species ResNet
gets the features extracted from the genus ResNet added right before the
final maxpool. Each image has a genus and a species label, and errors
backpropogate through both networks. The models are pretrained on
ImageNet. HGNN does better on the harder images (missing, occluded,
etc.). This work partially motivates BioCLIP because we noted that
biologists were using old models (ResNet) pretrained on general datsets
(ImageNet) instead of strong, domain-specific vision models.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10225">Cole et al.&#xA0;2022</a>
(<em>On Label Granularity and Object Localization</em>) compare the
effects of label granularity on weakly supervised object location
(WSOL). The goal of WSOL is to produce the bounding box for an object in
an image where the image contains exactly one object and you know the
class. That is, <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) \rightarrow
b\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times
w \times 3}, y \in \mathcal{C}, b \in \mathbb{R}^{4}\)</span>. However,
during training, you do not have lots of bounding boxes <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Instead, the model must learn from a
large set of <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> pairs and only a
few <span class="math inline">\(x, y, b\)</span> triplets. This work
proposes a new WSOL dataset that is a subset of the iNat21 dataset, and
shows that using coarser class labels (like order or class instead of
species or genus) leads to stronger performance on the WSOL task.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05837">Cole et al.&#xA0;2022</a>
(<em>When Does Contrastive Visual Representation Learning Work?</em>)
investigate self-supervised pretraining beyond ImageNet. The most
relevant section compares the differences between self-supervised
pretraining on different granularities on both iNat21 and ImageNet. The
authors find that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">SimCLR</a>
(their chosen self-supervised pretraining method) underperforms
supervised methods on the finest-grained tasks.</p>

<p>A relevant question for BioCLIP: does our species-level accuracy
degrade as quickly? The authors also bring up the idea that contrastive
learning might have a coarse-grained bias. I think this is very likely.
I think that contrastive learning, based on its random sampling of
negatives in the batch, is likely to sample examples that are
dramatically different from the true positive, so the model doesn&#x2019;t need
to learn fine-grained instances. In a sense, after learning these
coarser features, you want to choose examples that are very similar,
then use those to force fine-grained representations.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
This would also be relevant in BioCLIP, where near the start of
training, we could sample examples that have the same kingdom but
different phylum, then at the end of training, sample examples that have
the same kingdom, phylum, &#x2026;, genus, but different species.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13207">Zhang et al.&#xA0;2022</a>
(<em>Use All The Labels: A Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning
Framework</em>) propose a contrastive learning framework where the
hierarchical distance between labels corresponds to the desired distance
in the embedding space.</p>

<p>This actually outperforms cross entropy on both ImageNet and iNat17
in top-1 accuracy:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<th>ImageNet</th>
<th>iNat17</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SimCLR</td>
<td>69.53</td>

<td>56.8</td>

<td><strong>79.1</strong></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>On the other hand, 56.8 top-1 accuracy on iNat17 is
<em>horrifically</em> low. They use a ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet
and only finetune the fourh layer&#x2019;s parameters, which is a pretty weird
choice.</p>
