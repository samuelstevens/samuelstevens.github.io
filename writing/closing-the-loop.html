<p>My thesis is probably going to be about developing AI for science,
with a particular focus on ecology and organismal biology as the fields
of science. Because of this, I think a lot about how to get my research
into the hands of scientists, particularly those who are not familiar
with AI, with programming, with software in general. That tends to lead
to a very large improvement&#x2014;if someone is already using ResNets to
analyze data, switching to BioCLIP is an improvement, but not as big an
improvement as getting BioCLIP in the hands of someone who analyzes data
with their eyes and writes notes down. However, these users are also the
least likely to use my research without any support from me.</p>
