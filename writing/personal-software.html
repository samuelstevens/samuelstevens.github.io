<h1 id="personal-software">Personal Software</h1>
<p>I find myself more and more disappointed in the state of most
software, and I&#x2019;m writing more and more tools for myself. I enumerate
the kinds of bugs I experience that make software feel low-quality, then
I discuss some examples of tools I&#x2019;ve built, and I finish by discussing
languages that I think offer the most support for building the kinds of
tools I&#x2019;m describing.</p>
<h2 id="software-is-crap">Software is Crap</h2>
<!-- software is crap -->
<p>In my (admittedly limited, extremely narrow) experience, most
software is crap. It&#x2019;s amazing that we can communicate wirelessly and
work remotely and share information easily! But the dedication to
quality in most software is poor, and the overall effect for me is to
make software feel like crap.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples.</p>
<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>
<p>The desktop Spotify app takes 10+ seconds to fully open on my brand
new Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro chip. By fully open, I mean all album art
loads, main pages are completely filled, etc. This is after
opening/closing it less than thirty seconds before, so I don&#x2019;t think
it&#x2019;s because there are invalid cached files. Even Microsoft teams takes
less than 4 seconds (but there are other issues with Teams).</p>
<p>Spotify also continues to recommend podcasts, and most recently,
audiobooks to my account. I don&#x2019;t want to listen to podcasts or
audiobooks on Spotify. If I wanted to listen to podcasts, I would do so
on podcast app. Same goes for audiobooks. If I didn&#x2019;t pay for Spotify,
this wouldn&#x2019;t make me unhappy, because, as the saying goes, <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/03/05/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-you-become-the-product/">&#x201C;if
you&#x2019;re not paying for it, <em>you&#x2019;re</em> the product&#x201D;</a>. But I pay
for this product!</p>
<p>If I queue songs on Spotify desktop while listening on my phone, the
queue sometimes disappears.</p>
<p>For a while, when I opened an album on Spotify iOS, if I swiped back,
then my scroll position would reset to the top of the screen (this one
almost had me back to <a href="ios-13s-music-app-sucks">Apple
Music</a>).</p>
<p>Then, because Spotify changed their web API structure (well within
their rights as a private company), <a
href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui">spotify-tui</a> <a
href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui/issues/960">broke</a>.
Unfortunately, the maintainer is busy with other projects (again, not
something I am complaining about). But somehow I am sad that a bug-free
product just grew a bug.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-teams">Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>Microsoft Teams is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever
needed to use, especially on macOS. Everything is slow. There isn&#x2019;t a
single page that doesn&#x2019;t take its sweet time to render.</p>
<p>You can only have page open at a time, so if you wanted to see a chat
and your calendar at the same time, you&#x2019;re out of luck. (This also means
you have to switch between pages; this wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad if the app was
snappy; see above.)</p>
<p>I find the information density very low; when I discovered the dense
chat setting, it made a huge quality of life difference. If only there
were a similar setting for the main channels.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The search implementation is really, really awful. There is no sort
and are no patterns for more specific search<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones">Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones</h3>
<p>My headphones use my phone&#x2019;s ringer volume, rather than the media
volume. When I start listening to music, the volume is all the way up
because I leave my ringer as loud as possible. Then when I adjust the
volume down, it adjusts my ringer volume as well, so my alarms all very
quiet after disconnecting.</p>
<h3 id="git">git</h3>
<p>Git&#x2019;s UX is garbage. This isn&#x2019;t a bug, and I know maintainers are
working on improving this situation, and needing to maintain backward
compatibility is hard. But the UX is pretty bad. Everything else is
amazing though!</p>

<!-- I write a lot of scripts and small software tools -->
<h2 id="tools-i-develop">Tools I Develop</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I end up spending a lot of time working on my own
solutions to make my computer use as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>I will discuss some examples so it&#x2019;s clear what kind of tools I want
to build.</p>
<h2 id="todo">todo</h2>
<p><code>todo</code> is an 80 line bash script that opens my editor in
<code>~/Documents/todo</code> with a file with the current day. If the
previous day&#x2019;s file exists, it copies it into today&#x2019;s file. It&#x2019;s
extremely simple and extremely practical.</p>
<h2 id="wiki">wiki</h2>
<p><code>wiki</code> is a 130 line fish script that makes it easy to
add, find and edit documents in <code>~/Documents/wiki</code>. It also
includes a basic tag system. I use it all the time for daily logs on
projects as well as snippets and other pieces of knowledge I don&#x2019;t want
to use.</p>
<h2 id="airpods.app">Airpods.app</h2>
<p><a href="/projects/airpods">Airpods.app</a> was a simple AppleScript
wrapper I built around a BluetoothConnector which let you connect to
Airpods really quickly.</p>
<h2 id="slow-youtube">Slow YouTube</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/elm-slow-youtube">Slow
YouTube</a> was a client-side only website built in Elm that only showed
the channels you wanted to subscribe to, and only the three most recent
videos. This prevented any sort of distractions or recommended videos.
There&#x2019;s an instance up at <a
href="https://samuelstevens.me/elm-slow-youtube/">samuelstevens.me/elm-slow-youtube</a>
if you have an API key you want to use.</p>
<h2 id="quiet-hacker-news">Quiet Hacker News</h2>
<p><a href="/elm-quiet-hn">Quiet HN</a> is an Elm app that shows the top
30 links from Hacker News without any comments. I use this site every
day.</p>
<h2 id="pycodesearch">pycodesearch</h2>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/pycodesearch"><code>pycodesearch</code></a>
is a command line search tool that lets you use regular expression
semantic search over Python codebases. You can find all matches for
<code>hi!.*sorry</code> in all string literals, for example.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is just a small list of examples. There are dozens of shell
functions, scripts and web apps that I develop for one-off use, which
sometimes are used all the time (<code>todo</code>, <code>wiki</code>)
and sometimes are used once and then never again (I&#x2019;m looking at you,
<code>pycodesearch</code>).</p>
<!-- what are the tradeoffs? -->
<h2 id="tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h2>
<p>Given that I am going to write a lot of small scripts/tools to make
my life better, <em>what&#x2019;s the best way to do it?</em></p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>The most important factor is how easy it is to get an initial version
working. Most of the time, I develop a tool because I am just fed up and
want something working <em>right this very second.</em> Scripting
languages, interpreted languages with interactive debuggers, languages
that I personally know very well, languages with large standard
libraries that don&#x2019;t need a lot of imports are all winners here. For
example, Python and fish are both winners for getting something done
quickly (see <a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/pycodesearch">pycodesearch</a> or
<a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_config/fish/functions/wiki.fish">wiki</a>
for examples in each of these languages).</p>
<h3 id="returning-to-development">Returning to Development</h3>
<p>Another important factor is how easy it is to come back and make
edits after a long time. Often I will get a version 1 finished, use it
and <em>adapt my workflow to the tool,</em> then realize a new feature
would be neat. But I haven&#x2019;t worked on the original tool in sometimes
months! So languages that improve ease of <em>returning to
development</em> are also better for this kind of software.</p>
<p>How would a language improve ease of returning to development? I
actually think of the language as encouraging me to make it easy for
myself, either through cultural norms or hard constraints.</p>
<p>For example, Elm&#x2019;s type sytem makes it very easy to return to
development. If you look at the commit history for
(elm-slow-youtube)[https://github.com/samuelstevens/elm-slow-youtube/commits/master],
you can see that I stopped working on it from August 8th until November
2nd. I explicitly remember coming back to the code and realizing how
easy it was to figure out what was going on (admittedly, it is a
particularly simple app) <em>because of the types.</em></p>
<p>As a counterexample, look at bash. Google&#x2019;s <a
href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html">style
guidelines for bash</a> explicitly tell you to not write anything
serious in bash:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or that
uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should rewrite it in a
more structured language <em>now.</em> Bear in mind that scripts grow.
Rewrite your script early to avoid a more time-consuming rewrite at a
later date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one more positive example, consider Go&#x2019;s culture of testing. The
standard library&#x2019;s test package is pretty good, so if you are building
something without external packages, you can still write tests (unlike
Python, where <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> is the only
sane option). Having both unit and integration tests help a <em>ton</em>
with coming back to a project. For example, when developing <a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/relic">relic</a>, I use existing
tests to ensure there are no breaking behavior changes. If a language
encourages the writing of tests through culture, language support, etc.,
I will be more likely to use them when working on personal projects.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>A third factor is performance, especially start-up speed. The
majority of tools I write are thin wrappers around my editor (see <a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/scripts/tree/main/todo">todo</a>
for a great example). If I have to start up an entire VM just to open my
editor, that&#x2019;s going to be a waste of time. Whenever possible, I want my
tools to be lightning quick. Performance doesn&#x2019;t matter for most
applications, except when you get such high-performance software that
you can completely upgrade your workflow. While developing relic, I
realized that being able to see patterns in hyperparameter configs just
by querying with <code>relic ls</code> meant I was making significantly
better decisions about what options to pursue, and I was doing it more
often than I would have if I had to fire up a Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>I want to discover those new workflows that dramatically improve my
ability to run ML experiments, track progress, develop new insights,
etc. If a 20% slowdown in software performance prevents me from doing
that, that&#x2019;s not a 20% loss in progress, it could be closer to 100%.</p>
<p>500ms vs 600ms doesn&#x2019;t make a big difference. But 200ms vs 20ms
does.</p>
<p><strong>Speed matters when it can affect your workflow.</strong></p>
<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<p>The last relevant factor is how easy it is to run on different
environments. Python is great except you need a python interpreter
installed (and it needs to be the right version) and you need all
dependencies installed. Then you need to make it available in your path,
and that installed interpreter and dependencies can&#x2019;t conflict with your
other virtual environments&#x2026;fine, I&#x2019;ll just write a bash script
instead.</p>
<p>These are the benefits of Rust and Go&#x2013;I don&#x2019;t use any systems without
a relatively modern libc, so I don&#x2019;t need to get into the whole
static-vs-dynamically-linked debate. I just don&#x2019;t want to deal with
<code>node_modules/</code> or <code>venv/</code> in my
<code>$HOME</code>.</p>
<!-- what are the options? -->
<h2 id="options">Options</h2>
<p>There are four main options available to me, depending on what kind
of tool I want to build. Then there are some other options that might be
worth the learning curve if I discover glaring deficiencies in my
already known languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is also a Part II of my <a href="programming-languages">initial
debate on programming langauges</a>, but specific to writing personal
tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="contendors">Contendors</h3>
<p>These are the options I reach for every single time when I need to
write a tool. They (mostly) embody the traits I mentioned earlier.</p>
<h4 id="fish">Fish</h4>
<p>Fish is better than bash for writing scripts. I rewrote my wiki
script in fish in a morning, and it didn&#x2019;t include <code>sed</code> or
<code>awk</code> once. All the options are nice and human readable, the
built-ins are very well documented. It&#x2019;s a shell, so it&#x2019;s great for
manipulating some other commmands (ripgrep, fzf and fd) and it has very
low startup time. It doesn&#x2019;t have any support for unit testing (it&#x2019;s
still a shell langauge), but it&#x2019;s easier to read than bash and doesn&#x2019;t
care about being POSIX compatible (which is fine by me).</p>
<h4 id="go">Go</h4>
<p>Go (cross-)compiles to single binaries, has great test support, has a
great standard library (but you can use packages easily because it
compiles to a single binary), has strong performance and is easy to
write (but you do have to write a <em>lot</em> of it). The downside is
that you have to write a lot of it, you can&#x2019;t have unused variables, you
need to set up a <code>go.mod</code> to start, etc., which makes it
harder to get started. But if you develop version 0 in an easy language,
then develop your workflow around version 0, then decide you need a real
version 1, Go is probably a good choice.</p>
<h4 id="python">Python</h4>
<p>I write enough Python that, for example, I can add an argument parser
without consulting documentation. That alone makes Python useful for
getting shit done because I can just sit down and crank it out. If I
need a script for an existing Python project, I will write it in Python
because I know I&#x2019;ll have an interpreter available. If I want to write a
standalone program, I will rarely use Python because of the distribution
hassle.</p>
<h4 id="elm">Elm</h4>
<p>Elm is the only sane way to write web interfaces. Given the choice, I
would re-write <a href="https://salty.software/ticketbay">TicketBay</a>
as a web app in Elm every day of the week. It takes a little bit to get
started, but if I&#x2019;m writing a whole web interface then I might as well
write it once instead of writing it in html/css/js, then typescript,
then react, then elm. Plus the build system doesn&#x2019;t exist, whereas I
have to relearn webpack/babel/esbuild/(whatever the JavaScript community
is doing) every single time I use them.</p>
<h3 id="worth-the-learning-curve">Worth the Learning Curve?</h3>
<p>Should I learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, <a
href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, <a
href="https://sr.ht/~duangle/scopes/">Scopes</a>, <a
href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>, <a
href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a>, <a
href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>, <a
href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a> or <a
href="https://dlang.org/">D</a>?</p>
<p>All of these languages would replace Go in my personal dev use. They
all compile to native executables. Some notable differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust, Zig, Scopes and Odin don&#x2019;t have garbage collection.</li>
<li>Rust and Scopes use a borrow checker.</li>
<li>Janet is a Lisp-like language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Writing this post helped me clarify my position on what software I
should use to write personal software. The answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>fish for shell scripts/wrappers around $EDITOR</li>
<li>Go for more serious CLI utilities</li>
<li>Python for tools inside existing Python projects</li>
<li>Elm for web UIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions that are still unanswered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should I use for writing desktop app(let)s? Things with a
single-page GUI that edit some configs or move some files, etc.</li>
<li>What should I use for terminal-based UIs? Maybe Go is best (like <a
href="https://github.com/normen/whatscli">whatscli</a>). There is also
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">textual</a> in Python,
but then we have the distribution issues associated with Python.</li>
<li>Should I be writing these tools in languages without garbage
collection for maximum speed? Since they are often very simple, I
wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about the complexity of managing lots of objects
myself.</li>
<li>Should I look into Janet? Lisps are, you know, Lisp. Apparently
something magical happens (<a href="lisp">but I don&#x2019;t get it
yet</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix-editor-plugins">Appendix: $EDITOR &amp; Plugins</h2>
<p>None of this even considers the application I use the most: (Neo)Vim.
Given that NeoVim added Lua to make plugins easier to write, why don&#x2019;t I
write plugins for my editor? Those have to be some of the highest impact
tools I can write, but learning how to interact with NeoVim just feels
so hard.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune">kakoune</a> has
a more consistent UX, should I use that? I would love to use <a
href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix">helix</a> but there is no
soft-wrapping (<a
href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/136">issue</a>).</p>
