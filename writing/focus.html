      <p>While thinking about hard problems, I started thinking about how hard it is to stay focused. There are a lot of things I want to do, from exercising to programming to writing to reading to meeting new people. So why do I keep spending time on YouTube, Reddit, etc.? Why is it so hard to stay focused?</p>
      <p>At first I thought it was because I can get around whatever technical distraction-blocking tool I&#x2019;m using. At first, the uBlock Origin page coming up whenever I visited Youtube was enough for me to realize that I should stop. Then I clicked the &#x201C;visit anyways&#x201D; button once because I really felt like watching some videos, and the floodgates burst. After that, the extra uBlock page was just another step in getting to YouTube, and I didn&#x2019;t even register it.</p>
      <p>But a teacher told a group of us that we needed to work on our attention spans, because we hadn&#x2019;t spent enough time studying some artwork. That also made me think, because I&#x2019;ve never considered that I have an attention span problem. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t that I couldn&#x2019;t stay focused, but that I am easily distracted.</p>
      <p>I think there&#x2019;s an important distinction between staying focused and getting distracted. I feel like I can stay focused for many, many hours. If there&#x2019;s an interesting problem in front of me, I can stay focused on it. But if there&#x2019;s nothing that&#x2019;s absolutely interesting in front of me, then I&#x2019;m really good at opening YouTube before I know what&#x2019;s happening. The worst is when I sit down at my desk after school. I open my laptop, open a new browser tab, and there&#x2019;s nothing there. It&#x2019;s a permanent disaster.</p>
      <p>It&#x2019;s not the laptop or the web browser that distracts me. I do lots of productive work with a web browser on my laptop. It&#x2019;s the blank canvas that a browser tab represents. It forces me to both ignore all distractions on the internet <em>and</em> think of something productive that I want to do. My little brain can&#x2019;t handle it, and I end up on YouTube.</p>
      <p>It&#x2019;s more important for me to always have something interesting, rather than avoid distractions. Instead of looking for the ultimate distraction-blocking tool, I want to be led to interesting (and useful) things, where I can happily spend many hours.</p>
      <p>Luckily, I have such a tool. A pad of paper and a pen. When confronted with a blank canvas where my only options are to think, write, or read what I&#x2019;ve written, I do pretty well. The key is to not open a laptop (or phone) until I know exactly what I&#x2019;m going to do with it, and then do that. I leave my laptop and phone in a drawer in my desk and leave the legal pad on my desk with a pen (unfortunately, while I&#x2019;m in Dresden, my laptop is also my apartment&#x2019;s router. It can&#x2019;t really be moved).</p>
