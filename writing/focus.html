<h1 id="focus">Focus</h1>
<p>While thinking about hard problems, I started thinking about how hard
it is to stay focused. There are a lot of things I want to do, from
exercising to programming to writing to reading to meeting new people.
So why do I keep spending time on YouTube, Reddit, etc.? Why is it so
hard to stay focused?</p>
<p>At first I thought it was because I can get around whatever technical
distraction-blocking tool I&#x2019;m using. At first, the uBlock Origin page
coming up whenever I visited YouTube was enough for me to realize that I
should stop. Then I clicked the visit anyways button once because I
really felt like watching some videos, and the floodgates burst. After
that, the extra uBlock page was just another step in getting to YouTube,
and I didn&#x2019;t even register it.</p>
<p>But a teacher told a group of us that we needed to work on our
attention spans, because we hadn&#x2019;t spent enough time studying some
artwork. That also made me think, because I&#x2019;ve never considered that I
have an attention span problem. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t that I couldn&#x2019;t stay
focused, but that I am easily distracted.</p>
<p>I think there&#x2019;s an important distinction between staying focused and
getting distracted. I feel like I can stay focused for many, many hours.
If Therese an interesting problem in front of me, I can stay focused on
it. But if Theresa nothing that&#x2019;s absolutely interesting in front of me,
then I&#x2019;m really good at opening YouTube before I know whats happening.
The worst is when I sit down at my desk after school. I open my laptop,
open a new browser tab, and there&#x2019;s nothing there. It&#x2019;s a permanent
disaster.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not the laptop or the web browser that distracts me. I do lots
of productive work with a web browser on my laptop. It&#x2019;s the blank
canvas that a browser tab represents. It forces me to both ignore all
distractions on the internet <em>and</em> think of something productive
that I want to do. My little brain can&#x2019;t handle it, and I end up on
YouTube.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s more important for me to always have something interesting,
rather than avoid distractions. Instead of looking for the ultimate
distraction-blocking tool, I want to be led to interesting (and useful)
things, where I can happily spend many hours.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have such a tool. A pad of paper and a pen. When
confronted with a blank canvas where my only options are to think,
write, or read what I&#x2019;ve written, I do pretty well. The key is to not
open a laptop (or phone) until I know exactly what I&#x2019;m going to do with
it, and then do that. I leave my laptop and phone in a drawer in my desk
and leave the legal pad on my desk with a pen (unfortunately, while I&#x2019;m
in Dresden, my laptop is also my apartments router. It can&#x2019;t really be
moved).</p>
<h2 id="update-jan-14th-2020">UPDATE Jan 14th, 2020:</h2>
<p>Another technique that has helped/is currently helping is to make the
problems big. When focusing on a big problem (research problem, startup
problem), I always know what I should be doing, so I don&#x2019;t need the
paper and pen step. In fact, this has been one the best things about
doing undergrad research: it is so much more interesting than courses,
that I rarely get distracted. I open up my laptop and know exactly what
I&#x2019;m supposed to be doing, because I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about it.</p>
