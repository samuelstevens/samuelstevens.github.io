<p>I&#x2019;m working with ecologists and there&#x2019;s a ton of background knowledge
for me to get up to speed on. There&#x2019;s also a ton of background culture
for me to get up to speed on. If I want to change the way science is
performed, I need to understand how it&#x2019;s performed now and <em>why</em>
(<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton&#39;s_fence">Chesterton&#x2019;s
Fence</a>) before I suggest changes. That&#x2019;s taking up a bunch of my
mental energy because some things completely backwards and so they
require deep thought before I understand it. Compared to ML/AI research,
where I know the problems, the motivations, the limitations, and I can
understand most papers&#x2019; motivations and inuition easily, ecology is
really draining for me.</p>
<p>So here are some ongoing thoughts for me to continue thinking about.
Basically all of this could be wrong because I&#x2019;m not an ecologist.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-trends">Searching for Trends</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;m working on finding relationships between elytra size in
<em>Carabid</em> beetles (ground beetles) and other factors, such as
latitude, temperature, humidity, etc. As I understand it, the holy grail
is finding something like elytra size <span
class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> humidity with some error. We find
a linear relationship with a bias term and some error/noise, but we
discover a new linear relationship that holds across all beetles
everywhere. This is the best. It&#x2019;s also unlikely that a relationship
that simple exists at all, much less has not been discovered
already.</p>
<p>How do we find relationships? To me, this is a search problem. We
have lots of variables, lots of ways to compose the variables, and
methods to score the fit of each variable composition. For example, we
might try the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>elytra width = humidity * beta + alpha</code></li>
<li><code>elytra width / beetle mass = humidity * beta + alpha</code></li>
<li><code>elytra width / beetle mass = humidity * beta + temperature * delta + alpha</code></li>
<li><code>elytra width / beetle mass = humidity * temperature * beta + alpha</code></li>
<li>&#x2026;and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can compose increasingly complex relationships by adding both more
variables and more interactions between variables. Some of these make
sense: we probably care about elytra width with respect to body size
(sort of controlling for body size). Some of them don&#x2019;t: I&#x2019;m not sure
what <code>humidity * temperature</code> would indicate.</p>
<p>But we have a couple guiding principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Simpler is better.</li>
<li>Better fits are better.</li>
<li>Plausible compsitions are better.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are nice, easy ways to measure #1 and #2. #3 is much harder to
evaluate, but I suspect could be done by an LLM with enough guidance. If
you have a search space and a ranking function, this is a problem that
can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Why would I manually go through all the possible combinations based
on my own intuition, rather than do massive search and then manually
evaluate the top candidates?</p>
<hr />
<p>Some discussion of this with LLMs:</p>
