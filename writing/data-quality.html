<h1 id="data-quality">Data Quality</h1>
<p>Broadly, I am interested in choosing better data for large-scale
machine learning models. There are lots of heuristics for choosing
better data, and even more modality-specific heuristics. But there are
very few general techniques for choosing better data.</p>
<p>Here are some notes and thoughts from other papers that emphasize
data quality.</p>
<p>Lillian Weng (of course) has a <a
href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-02-05-human-data-quality/#data-quality--model-training">great,
high-quality summary</a> of influential papers in this area.</p>
<h2 id="reading-list">Reading List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence
Functions</li>
<li>Understanding Influence Functions and Datamodels via Harmonic
Analysis</li>
<li>Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions</li>
<li>Dataset Cartography: Mapping and Diagnosing Datasets with Training
Dynamics</li>
<li>An Empirical Study of Example Forgetting during Deep Neural Network
Learning</li>
<li>Identifying Mislabeled Data using the Area Under the Margin
Ranking</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Data influence functions enable us to see how a single training data
point influences predictions, cheaply. We basically can simulate
removing a single example from a pre-trained model&#x2019;s training set, then
re-evaluate the model on whatever benchmark we like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does removing just one example make a meaningful difference on
benchmarks? If not, are influence functions good approximations of
removing multiple examples?</li>
<li>Broadly, influence functions should help us find examples that are
high quality or low quality. But what&#x2019;s the difference between using an
influence function and just measuring high and low loss examples?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dinov2">DINOv2</h2>
<ul>
<li>They take some curated datasets, then pick out images that are
similar to those curated images, using some measure of &#x201C;similarity&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pre-train ViT-H/16 on IN21K</li>
<li>Embed all images</li>
<li>k-means clustering using cosine similarity</li>
<li>For a curated image, retrieve N similar images</li>
</ol>
<p>As a data ablation, they try three different pre-training
datasets:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>LVD-142M (above)</li>
<li>IN21K</li>
<li>142M randomly sampled images from the 1.2B uncurated images</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that all three of these are unsupervised! There is no notion of
label quality here.</p>
<p>They have details on their pipeline, but few design ablations.</p>
<h2 id="data-filtering-networks-dfn">Data Filtering Networks (DFN)</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you train a small CLIP on small-scale, really-high quality data,
you can use that to filter a larger uncurated image-text dataset and
make a really good image-text dataset</li>
<li>but they use 350M high-quality image-text pairs to train their DFN.
that&#x2019;s almost 400M, which openai used for WIT. why not just train an
image-text model directly on the 350M high-quality pairs?</li>
</ul>
