<p>10,000 hours is the magic number to become an expert,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
which is supposedly a PhD of work (8 hours/day * 5 days/week * 50
weeks/year * 5 years = 10K hours). I worry that I am not doing enough
deliberate work to reach 10K hours. As a result, I want to focus on
doing <em>more</em> work. But not simply sitting in front of my computer
more. I want to have more tangible outputs of my work. This doesn&#x2019;t have
to be accepted papers, or even submitted papers. But it should be things
I can both control and quantify, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog posts</li>
<li>Number of experiments</li>
<li>Lines of code committed</li>
<li>Reproduced papers</li>
<li>Technical reports</li>
<li>Submitted papers</li>
<li>Preprints</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are things within my control and can be counted.
I&#x2019;m not committing trying to make these numbers go up. But as Peter
Drucker supposedly said, &#x201C;What gets measured gets improved.&#x201D; So I will
measure these things. I&#x2019;ll put them on my website and on my bulletin
board in my office.</p>
<p>And hopefully, I will have more tangible outputs, and my intuitions
arounding research will improve.</p>
