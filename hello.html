  GE Aviation is a powerhouse engineering firm, and has recently expanded their
  digital offerings, beginning in the Aviation company. I was fortunate enough
  to intern at GE Aviation after graduating high school in 2017, and returned in
  2018 to continue my learning. While at GE, I developed full stack applications
  and furthered my knowledge of formal, corporate software development.

    >Penn State football game in 2017</a
  >. As a football fan, it was atrocious to me that he didn&#39;t get to enjoy
  that game. We devised a plan to make it easier for Buckeye students to buy and
  sell tickets to each other. In the process, we discovered that football
  attendance has been steadily dropping, leading to emptier and emptier
  stadiums. We set out to make an app that was Buckeye in every way possible,
  and along with 2 other students, released

  aging seniors. She needed a developer to implement the technical component of
  her study, allowing her to record usage data from study participants
  automatically, dramatically improving accuracy and quantity of data.
