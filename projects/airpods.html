<h1 id="airpods">Airpods</h1>
<p>I developed <em>Airpods</em>, a macOS app that is a simple wrapper for lapfelix&#x2019;s awesome <a href="https://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector">BluetoothConnector</a>. If you install <em>Airpods</em>, and you use Spotlight Search (like me), then you can go <code>CMD+SPACE Airp...</code> and <em>smash</em> <code>ENTER</code> to disconnect or connect to your airpods (assuming you only have one pair).</p>
<p>The build process is wildly convoluted and could be fixed with a makefile (I think, I still need to learn how to use makefiles, but I hear amazing things about them. What&#x2019;s the difference between a makefile and a bash script?), but it works and is documented.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d like to eventually publish this on the App Store, but I also needed to get this off my plate, and it currently works.</p>

<p>I added a simple <code>print</code> option to BluetoothConnector so that I could use an image of Airpods for the notifications, but other than that, just used the default BluetoothConnnector commands and packaged the binary with my .app/.dmg so that it has no external dependencies.</p>
