<h1 id="quiet-hacker-news">Quiet Hacker News</h1>
<p>Quiet HN was featured on Hacker News several months ago. It was a
website that showed the top 30 links from Hacker News, with no comments.
It was supposed to help the site author focus on the story contents,
rather than just read the comments. The site was written in Go, and I
believe it&#x2019;s now a Gophercise. Whatever the case, the site is no longer
up at <a href="https://quiethn.com">quiethn.com</a>.</p>
<p>While talking with some friends, I figured that the app could be done
purely client-side since the Hacker News API doesn&#x2019;t require an API key.
So I wrote it in Elm to practice the ol&#x2019; functional programming, and
then hosted it with GitHub pages.</p>
<p><a href="/elm-quiet-hn" target="_blank" data-no-instant>You can visit
the website here.</a></p>
<p>(The original site also had really minimal CSS, just like my
remake.)</p>
<p>Honestly, full client-side apps that are hosted for free through my
GitHub account is <em>sweet</em>. Deploying is easy, they basically
never go down (as far as I can tell), and I don&#x2019;t have any server
maintenance to do.</p>
<p>Source code is <a
href="https://github.com/samuelstevens/elm-quiet-hn">here</a>, but it&#x2019;s
not pretty. So it goes, when the compiler prevents you from ever making
mistakes.</p>
