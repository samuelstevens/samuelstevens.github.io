    <h1>Website Blocked.</h1>
    <p>
      Instead of wasting time, use this time to work on something that will make you happier in the future.
    </p>

    <p>Options include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research</li>
      <li>This page</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ideas for this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Command line snippets to get me started with the project (open terminal, VSCode, etc).</li>
      <li>Someway to edit this page from the browser? Could also set Leechblock to open Google Drive or some online
        editor.</li>
      <li>Even just styling this page is better than watching another video on YouTube.</li>
