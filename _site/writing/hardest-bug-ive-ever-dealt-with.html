<h1 id="hardest-bug-ive-ever-dealt-with">Hardest Bug I&#x2019;ve Ever Dealt
With</h1>
<p>The Hardest Bug I&#x2019;ve Ever Dealt With was actually not a bug in the
sense of code not doing what I wanted. It was <em>email</em> not doing
what I wanted, and then the challenges that came with bending the code
to meet the email standards.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://salty.software/ticketbay">TicketBay</a>, we sent
confirmation emails to new users so that only Ohio State students could
use the app. These emails included a link with a big hash as a query
parameter so that we could be sure it was unique, only they could click
on it, and we could be sure it was their account. Pretty standard stuff,
I&#x2019;m sure everyone has gotten dozens of these emails.</p>
<p>Except nearly <em>all of our emails went to junk or spam</em>. And we
could not figure out why. We had added rDNS, DKIM, TXT records, all this
stuff that was recommended.</p>
<p><em>(I&#x2019;ll be honest; we did not do as much as a deep dive into mail
as I wish we had. Setting up email was a low priority for us, and when I
couldn&#x2019;t get postfix working on a EC2 box in under two days, I called it
quits and went with Zoho mail.)</em></p>
<p>Eventually I started looking for why email clients would mark emails
as spam, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags (links) were one of the
reasons. So I removed all the links from the email, <strong>including
the all-important confirmation link</strong>. Still went to spam.
Removed the image which was hosted at <a
href="https://salty.software">salty.software</a></p>
<p><strong>Did not go to spam.</strong></p>
<p>That completed finding the cause of the bug. I had sent myself
hundreds of emails over 4 hours, and despite the fact that I basically
deleted every email as soon as it delivered to my inbox, I could still
send an automated email to myself with no links and it would not go to
spam.</p>
<p>Actually <em>fixing</em> the bug required building a system where we
could send confirmation emails without a link (and eventually I forgot
my password emails as well). We had been talking about Slacks magic link
login, and all thought that was better than passwords, but we couldn&#x2019;t
send links.</p>
<p>This led us to sending a passcode confirmation email, with some
randomly generated passcode of numbers and letters that users could
copy-paste into TicketBay when signing up for the first time.</p>
<p>This system would actually solve a number of problems at once.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Confirmation and password emails went to spam.</p></li>
<li><p>Passwords are dangerous to store because you can accidentally
store them in plain text.</p></li>
<li><p>The forgot password authentication flow was awful and confusing
and nobody knew how or why it worked.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With the new confirmation <del>link</del> <em>passcode</em> system,
emails would not go to spam because there were no links.</p>
<p>We didn&#x2019;t need to store user passwords, only a hashed version of the
random code we generated. We effectively created much more secure
passwords and then just emailed them to users.</p>
<p>You could never forget your password, because anytime you wanted to
log in, you needed to get a new confirmation code generated and sent to
you. There was no password to forget.</p>
<p>After deciding on the confirmation code system, the only thing to
worry about was implementation, and security assumptions.</p>
<p>We needed to balance security (making the code long enough and with a
large enough set of characters) with ease of use (easy to copy paste,
easy to see and understand what was going on). Eventually, we settled on
an 18 character passcode that was generated server side and stored as a
hash, just like a password. This was long enough to be secure, and short
enough to fit on one line for most peoples mobile email clients.</p>
<p>Were convinced this solution is secure for our users based on several
assumptions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A users email accounts is secure. Only they have access.</p></li>
<li><p>Storing a hash of a random 18 character string is
secure.</p></li>
<li><p>The passcode is not logged anywhere in plaintext.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>#3 is the only assumption that worried me. We use SendGrid and Zoho
mail to send our email, so the passcode is stored in plaintext on their
servers (AFAIK). So assumption #3 is really:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The passcode is not logged anywhere in plaintext on our server
instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoho Mail is secure and trustworthy.</p></li>
<li><p>SendGrid is secure and trustworthy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, based on the scope and security risk of our application, I
think we can safely make these assumptions. The most important piece of
data we store is users phone numbers, which has historically been public
information (in the yellow pages). Given this, I think we made the right
trade off between security, ease of use for our users, and development
time.</p>
