<p>Recently I started using test-driven development (TDD) for any project larger than a single file. The merits of TDD are widespread on the internet, so I only briefly repeat what you might already know: TDD (obviously) forces you to have at least some test written, often helps you write a wider range of test cases that cover more edge cases, and lets you trust your code to do what you expect. I want to talk about how long it took me to begin writing my code using TDD, considering that I&rsquo;d first heard about it would&rsquo;ve been sometime in high school.</p>
<p>My first experience with TDD was almost definitely somewhere on a developer-focused blog on the internet, where someone wrote an article dedicated to the benefits of TDD and why every developer should use it. I certainly found the idea interesting, but didn&rsquo;t see why I would need test cases; at the time, I was making little video games, and tested my code by just playing the game. If it worked, it worked. If not, I would fix it. Why did I need test code, and why would I ever write it <em>before</em> writing any real code?</p>
<p>In the spring of 2018, I took my first software design class at OSU. About halfway through the class, our homework was to write test cases for various implementations of basic data structures in Java: maps, sets, queues, stuff like that. I remember thinking how pointless it was, because many of the implementations were really boring; we built a queue on top of an ArrayList. I couldn&rsquo;t fathom needing test cases for that.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2018, I worked at GE Aviation developing an end-to-end testing solution; we were using browser automation tools to test front end, back end, and database code all at once. It was slow, would often fail for no reason, and required a whole lot of work on our part to integrate with GitHub, Docker, AWS, and some reporting tool that I can&rsquo;t remember. Even then, as I developed an automated testing solution, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why I would want to write tests for my own code. Not only did I not use TDD, I didn&rsquo;t even write test code.</p>
<p>That same summer, some friends and I were developing a mobile app called TicketBay. I ended up handling many of the pull requests, and eventually wrote a note that had all the of the tests for the pull request to be approved - [[PR # - Base]]. Every time there was a pull request for front end <em>or</em> backend code, I would start both instances up on my local, and run through the series of tests on the iPhone simulator, grinding my way through every conceivable action that someone could do, including odd series of actions that we knew had caused bugs in the past. I remember thinking about automating those tests, but couldn&rsquo;t see a simple solution, and didn&rsquo;t even consider writing tests for individual functions or chunks of code. Guess I was too focused on end-to-end testing because of my time at GE. Plus I was younger and dumber than I am now.</p>
<p>In addition to TicketBay, a friend and I were working on a web and mobile application for a professor at The Ohio State University that basically showed some media to patients and then tracked their responses to it. Anyone reading knows where this is going: I wrote code for the whole stack, and didn&rsquo;t write a single test case.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fall of 2018, when I took my second software design class, we started implementing some Java data structures using linked lists, which suddenly didn&rsquo;t make as much sense as ArrayLists. Then my roommate and I remembered our test cases from the previous semester and started using those to make sure our code was correct. Suddenly, I was confident that my implementation was fine; the tests all passed. I didn&rsquo;t realize it then, but that was TDD, just spread over a summer break.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I still didn&rsquo;t write test code for any personal project. Or any project that I was being paid for.</p>
<p>Finally, after reading about TDD, working with QA engineers on automated testing, then using my own homework as test cases, I realized the benefits. I can now say for certain that I write test cases for any function, no matter how trivial. I also do my best to write stateless functions, because they make my test cases so much easier to write. But most importantly, when I know I have a new function to write, I write the test cases first.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve seen the light, almost 3 years after someone told me that I should use TDD, I began to wonder what else I missing out on. I&rsquo;ve always been of the mindset that I should experiment and think about what works for me, and see if I arrive at the same conclusions as everyone else. I did in fact arrive at the conclusion that TDD is a powerful way to make sure my code works. But what if I had tried it earlier? I could&rsquo;ve saved years of shitty code. That got me thinking about what else I was missing out on. Especially after spending some time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://paulgraham.net">Paul Graham&rsquo;s</a> personal website, I started thinking about Lisp and that family of languages. They&rsquo;re quite highly revered by both websites, and I thought I would give it a shot. Common Lisp is really cool. Really hard to think about. Really, really cool. I tried podcasts, because everyone I know <em>loves</em> podcasts. They don&rsquo;t work for me, because I don&rsquo;t have a good time to listen to them. I don&rsquo;t drive anywhere. I&rsquo;d rather read transcripts.</p>
<p>The moral of my TDD story is not to do whatever you read about. But I do think you should <em>try</em> more things, especially when you think it&rsquo;s from a trusted source, or a relatively smart source. Experiment more, and learn from people who are smarter than you.</p></article>
