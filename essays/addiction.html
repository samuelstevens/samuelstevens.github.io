            Note: I've been thinking a lot recently about behavioral and
            smartphone addiction, and decided to write some of my thoughts down.
            I plan to continue working on this document, adding graphics and
            sources to the claims I make.
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            Behavioral addiction is just as real a form of addiction as a
            substance addiction. It leads to similarly life-changing effects,
            can cause just as much destruction, but receives significantly less
            attention, both from the government and an addict's friends and
            family, typically the first people to notice.
          </p>

          <p class="essay-text">
            Actions that we take lead to patterns of activity in our brain, as a
            reward or punishment determined by tens of thousands of years of
            evolution. Eat a sweet, healthy dense apple? Your brain fires in a
            different way than when you stub your toe on the couch. Your brain
            fires in a certain pattern for when you drink a beer, when a heroin
            addict gets their latest hit, or when an internet addict loads up
            Reddit for the 5th time that day.
            <a href="#claire-gillian">Claire Gillian</a>, a neurologist studying
            obsessive and repetitive behaviors, explains that, “Drugs and
            addictive behaviors active the the same reward center in the brain.”
            However, this means that addictions to behaviors can creep up on
            us—how can videos of cats produce the same effect in me as a beer to
            an alcoholic or meth to an addict?
          </p>

          <p class="essay-text">
            No behavior is truly addicting until we develop a physiological
            dependence on a particular behavior.
            <a href="#irresistible-1">
              Adam Alter explains this concisely in Irrestible</a
            >: “Just as drugs trigger dopamine production, so do behavioral
            cues.” This mean that when I’m exhausted from a week of travel for
            work, I want to have a nice meal of home cooked chicken parmesan,
            and the feeling of relaxation I associate with such a meal is real.
            When I’ve had a long day, talking to my girlfriend about what went
            wrong and getting a hug will make all my problems seem smaller. When
            I’m stressed about emailing a particular professor or my boss,
            browsing Reddit for 15 minutes makes it seem easier to do such an
            insurmountable task as…writing an email?
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            How can skimming news and memes for 15 minutes be required for me to
            just write an email?
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            I’ve developed an <em>emotional dependence</em> on Reddit, and once
            I noticed this, I saw it everywhere. A little YouTube before
            homework, a little Reddit before starting an essay, a little
            Hearthstone before paying attention in class...it was everywhere in
            my life.
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            So behavioral addiction is real, and it comes about as a result of
            an emotional dependence. Now that I know that I’m addicted, I can
            kick the addiction and go back to being the focused, driven student
            I was before. Right?
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            The hard part is habits, and how we use habits all the time to avoid
            having to make decisions. The human brain limits energy used, and
            habits are how we avoid having to think and make conscious
            decisions. In The Power of Habit, the author describes a habit as:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p><em>cue</em> → <em>routine</em> → <em>reward</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="essay-text">
            Our brains will associate the relationship on a subconscious level:
            we encounter the cue, and know that performing the routine with lead
            to the reward. I’m hungry, and I know that eating food will make me
            feel better. I’m at a bar with friends, and I know that having a
            beer will make everything seem more fun. I’m bored standing in line,
            and pulling up Reddit will entertain me.
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            Except that more often than not, the reward isn’t a high level
            reward like “having fun” or “being entertained”. It’s much more
            primal: some dopamine/serotonin/etc will be released into your
            brain, making you literally feel pleasure. I can rationalize it, but
            the majority of the rewards just come back to dopamine, which is
            much, much harder to outthink. Now it becomes clearer that just
            deciding to <strong>not</strong> do whatever it is, is much harder.
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            It turns out that simply <strong>not</strong> doing whatever routine
            brings about that reward is really hard. We know this—it’s why the
            number 1 dieting tip is get rid of junk food from your house. It’s
            clear that if it’s within reach, relying on our own willpower is
            surefire (for most of us) path to failure. But we (most of us again)
            can’t get rid of our phones and computers. I’m a computer science
            major who likes to make mobile apps, for God’s sake. So how can I
            beat Facebook’s team of super genius engineers looking to make their
            experience as addictive as possible?
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            Let’s replace the routine. Studies have shown that not doing
            something is much easier when there’s something else to do. Drink
            some orange juice at the bar instead of a beer. Go for a job instead
            of smoking that cig. Read a book instead of browsing Reddit on the
            toilet. The cue is the same and the reward is slightly less, but we
            can form a new, overriding habit.
          </p>
          <p class="essay-text">
            But what about when I’m studying for an exam and need a break? It’s
            <em>so</em> easy to CTRL-T a new tab, and type “old.reddit.com” (I
            know, I know) before I can consciously think that I should read a
            book, and by the time I think about the book, there’s a good meme
            about Javascript that I just <strong>have</strong> to see. What if I
            had another website that replaced Reddit? If my fingers typed that
            new website into the search bar, and that website didn’t want to
            suck me in for hours for more advertising revenue, then maybe I
            would stand a chance.
          </p>

            This topic is what leads me to my next project (as of yet unnamed),
            that tries to act as a "nicotine patch" for social media. I thought
            getting my thoughts down on paper (or a screen) would help me
            articulate my argument for why such a website is necessary.
