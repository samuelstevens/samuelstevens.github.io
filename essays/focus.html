        <h1 id="focus">Focus</h1>
        <p>While thinking about hard problems, I started thinking about how hard it is to stay focused. There are a lot of things I want to do, from exercising to programming to writing to reading to meeting new people. So why do I keep spending time on YouTube, Reddit, etc.? Why is it so hard to stay focused?</p>
        <p>At first I thought it was because I can get around whatever technical distraction-blocking tool I&rsquo;m using. At first, the uBlock Origin page coming up whenever I visited Youtube was enough for me to realize that I should stop. Then I clicked the &ldquo;visit anyways&rdquo; button once because I really felt like watching some videos, and the floodgates burst. After that, the extra uBlock page was just another step in getting to YouTube, and I didn&rsquo;t even register it.</p>
        <p>But a teacher told a group of us that we needed to work on our attention spans, because we hadn&rsquo;t spent enough time studying some artwork. That also made me think, because I&rsquo;ve never considered that I have an attention span problem. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t that I couldn&rsquo;t stay focused, but that I am easily distracted.</p>
        <p>I think there&rsquo;s an important distinction between staying focused and getting distracted. I feel like I can stay focused for many, many hours. If there&rsquo;s an interesting problem in front of me, I can stay focused on it. But if there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s absolutely interesting in front of me, then I&rsquo;m really good at opening YouTube before I know what&rsquo;s happening. The worst is when I sit down at my desk after school. I open my laptop, open a new browser tab, and there&rsquo;s nothing there. It&rsquo;s a permanent disaster.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s not the laptop or the web browser that distracts me. I do lots of productive work with a web browser on my laptop. It&rsquo;s the blank canvas that a browser tab represents. It forces me to both ignore all distractions on the internet <em>and</em> think of something productive that I want to do. My little brain can&rsquo;t handle it, and I end up on YouTube.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s more important for me to always have something interesting, rather than avoid distractions. Instead of looking for the ultimate distraction-blocking tool, I want to be led to interesting (and useful) things, where I can happily spend many hours.</p>
        <p>Luckily, I have such a tool. A pad of paper and a pen. When confronted with a blank canvas where my only options are to think, write, or read what I&rsquo;ve written, I do pretty well. The key is to not open a laptop (or phone) until I know exactly what I&rsquo;m going to do with it, and then do that. I leave my laptop and phone in a drawer in my desk and leave the legal pad on my desk with a pen (unfortunately, while I&rsquo;m in Dresden, my laptop is also my apartment&rsquo;s router. It can&rsquo;t really be moved).</p>
